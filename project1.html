                <h1>KewBot</h1>
                <p>I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the eight students selected to represent Imperial College London during a five-week Summer School Program in Qingdao, China, at the <strong>Tsinghua Academy of Arts and Science Innovation Research (TASA)</strong>. I had the privilege of participating in the first-ever <strong>International Design Education Laboratory (EduLab)</strong>, organized by the International Council of Design and hosted by Tsinghua University.</p>
    
                <p>This unique event brought together four top Chinese design schools and four international institutions, including Imperial, to collaborate on addressing the future 2050 challenges. Each team was tasked with imagining a "<strong>positive 2050</strong>," where responsible consumption prevails, or a "<strong>bleak 2050</strong>," where overconsumption continues. We had the opportunity to present to industry and government a solution to those 2050 challenges.</p>
    
                <p>Our team was assigned the "<strong>good scenario</strong>," and we focused on KewBot, a health robot designed to enhance the well-being of elderly users through gardening. While it assists with gardening tasks, its primary goal is to <strong>improve both physical and mental health</strong>. KewBot adapts to each user’s needs, encouraging physical activity, reducing stress, and fostering social connections through community gardening. By integrating gardening into a health-focused routine, KewBot supports a healthier lifestyle, making it much more than just a gardening tool—it’s a health companion.</p>

            <p>The project began by envisioning our world in 2050. We developed a matrix to explore various future scenarios and quickly identified the development of green spaces, with a focus on the elderly, as the core area for our research.</p>
